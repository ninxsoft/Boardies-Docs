Follow the steps below to setup up accounts and configure custom API integrations. Instructions \u00b6 Info These instructions will use the Jamf Classic API as the example. From your Boardies document, open the Accounts window by clicking on the Accounts button in the toolbar: Click on the button to add an Account: Fill in the following account information: Name Description Host: Base URL of the server you will retrieve data from Authentication: Basic Auth or OAuth Username Password: Will be OAuth token if OAuth was selected for Authentication Nice to have Drop in a nice icon to help you distinguish between accounts! Click on the button to add an Integration: Fill in the following integration information: Name Endpoint: See below for a list of common REST APIs and endpoint documentation Filters: List of comma separated tokens to filter down retrieved data Info Leave the filters blank for now. They will be added in a couple of steps. Once all fields have been filled in, click Test to retrieve some data: Boardies will attempt to retrieve data based on the provided credentials. If everything looks good, the table will populate with results: In this example, we can see the results show a master dictionary containing an array of computers , containing dictionaries. To filter down the results, add computers to the Filters . Click Test again: We can now see just the filtered down computers array - there is no master dictionary. Let's filter down further. For arrays, we can filter by index. Add 0 to the Filters . Click Test again: We can now see just the first computer in the computers array. To drive the point home, add model to the Filters . Click Test again: We can now see just the model from the first computer in the computers array. This is a very specific example, but it illustrates how you can drill down to almost any bit of data you require. We will be using the Total Computers integration for other examples, so remove 0 and model from the Filters : Next Steps Visit Widgets - Text to see how you can use this API integration in a text widget.
